## Overview

The Now Platform comprises our API, clients and routing layer. All the individual components are designed to work together in cohesion according to the *platform version*.

### Versioning
There exist two major platform versions of Now:

- **1.0** (**legacy**).
- **2.0** (**default** as of **08-11-2018**).

As of **2.0**, there is no longer a concept of deployment **types**. All deployments can combine static and dynamic serverless entrypoints.

We recommend migrating to v2 for increased performance, security and new features by following our [upgrade guide](/docs/v2/platform/upgrade-to-2-0).

### Version Selection
All individual accounts and teams are always automatically on the latest default version of the platform if created on or after 29-10-2018**.**

If you already had an account, we recommend upgrading your default version to **latest** and then specify `version` inside your repositories for perfect future compatibility.

#### Team or Account Versioning
In our web dashboard, head to Settings by clicking on your profile picture while logged-in. 

<Note>please make sure to do this for each **context** you are interested in selecting a version for (i.e.: individual and/or teams).</Note>

If you created your account before 29-10-2018, you will be in the **v1 legacy platform**. Otherwise, you'll always be on the **latest** (v2 as of now). We recommend upgrading to v2 once you are confident you have [upgraded your projects](/docs/v2/platform/upgrade-to-2-0) or [pinned them](#per-project-version-pinning) to the corresponding version they are known to work with.

If your account or team is set to the latest, it is still a good idea to always include in `now.json` what version you want your project to be deployed against.

This ensures that as we continue to make improvements to our platform, your workflows are never disrupted.

#### Per-project Version Pinning
To maximize predictability and future compliance, we recommend that all your production applications explicitly declare what platform version they are known to work with on `now.json`:

```
{
  "version": 2
}
```

If you do not specify a version, [Now CLI](/docs/v2/getting-started/installation#now-cli) and [Now for GitHub](/docs/v2/integrations/now-for-github) will render a warning. If you do not have time to migrate an application to the latest platform version, you can always specify `"version": 1`.
